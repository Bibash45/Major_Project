        Since 1992, Food Donation Connection has assisted food service companies
        with the development and implementation of Harvest Programs designed to
        provide an alternative to discarding surplus food.
        <br />
        We have coordinated the donation of over 750 million pounds of quality
        prepared food from food service providers located in the United States,
        Canada, Poland, Spain, as well as in other countries. In 2021, 1,300
        business entities through 14,000+ food-service locations (restaurants,
        airports, travel plazas, retailers, hotels, universities, hospitals,
        distribution centers) donated 65 million pounds of prepared surplus food
        to 10,000 hunger relief organizations. <br />
        Our team members have experience with major restaurant chains and
        retailers in operations and food quality. Our entire full-time staff of
        30 team members is ServSafeÂ® certified in food safety.
