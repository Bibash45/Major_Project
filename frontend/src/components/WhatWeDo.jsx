        Food Donation Connection manages food donation programs for food service
        companies interested in donating food. The donating process is based on
        donors receiving economic benefit through tax savings in addition to
        involvement with community and corporate goodwill. See how one HMS Host
        team at Tampa International Airport used their surplus food to feed over
        100,000. <br />
        Donors are linked to those in need through existing non-profit hunger
        relief organizations.
        <br />
        Food Donation Connection administers these programs through the use of
        an efficient communication and reporting network. Program
        responsibilities include linking donor locations with food rescue groups
        or those feeding the needy, assisting in the development of product
        quality and handling standards, tax valuation, donation reporting and
        ongoing monitoring and follow-up to ensure program implementation and
        growth.
        <br />
        Food Donation Connection does not compete with non-profits for the
        limited funding that is currently available from government and private
        sources. Instead, our funding comes from a small portion of our donor
        partners incremental tax savings that is earned from properly saving and
        donating their surplus food. In exchange for this funding, we coordinate
        all aspects of our donor partner’s food donation programs.
        <br />
        Food Donation Connection currently coordinates Harvest Programs for
        Pizza Hut, KFC, Taco Bell, Whole Foods, NPC International, Olive Garden,
        Red Lobster, LongHorn Steakhouse, The Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze,
        Seasons 52, Grand Lux Café, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Famous Dave's,
        Auntie Anne's, Cracker Barrel, Chick-fil-A, Einstein Bros Bagles, Wawa,
        Outback Steakhouse, Bonefish Grill, and Fleming's Prime Steakhouse. We
        have several other major restaurant chains currently in the development
        stage of forming Harvest Programs.
